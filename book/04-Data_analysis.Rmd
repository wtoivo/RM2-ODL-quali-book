# Data analysis

This chapter has activities to support you with Thematic Analysis.We advise using Braun & Clarke (2006) to structure your data analysis. This can be accessed through the library, using the following link: https://tinyurl.com/ybrsf5eg. There is also a good overview in Braun & Clarke (2013), which is on the reading list.



## Overview of the phases of TA





## Coding (steps 1-2)

Here, we'll focus on Steps 1 and 2 of the process. These can be found on pages 87-89 of the Braun & Clarke (2006) paper. We also covered how to do the analysis in the Thematic Analysis lecture in Semester 1 Week 12.

### Step 1: Familiarisation with the data

  * Transcribing (or sorting/anonymising your transcript) helps you to become more familiar with your data
  * Read over the transcript, but do it in an 'active' way. This means reading while searching for meanings and patterns
  * Note down anything of interest that comes up

**Practical steps:**

Read through your transcript and take notes and/or make
comments in the margins. Generate a list of ideas: what is
interesting about the discussion?

### Step 2: Generating initial codes

  * Codes identify a feature of the data that seems interesting
  * The process of coding involves going through the transcript and thinking about the data, and picking out what seems interesting/important.
  * Coded data is specific (themes, which come later, are broad) -you will likely end up with quite a lot of different codes.
  * Code for as many patterns as you can at this point  - it won't all make it to the next stage, but it's good if you pick up as much as you can at this stage.
  
**Practical steps:**

Insert labels beside quotes - what is interesting about the quote? What does it tell us in relation to your research question?

### How to actually do the coding (logistically)?

There are many different ways to approach this - find the way that works for you! There are also different software to conduct thematic analysis (such as NVivo); you are welcome to use these if you wish, but due to the introductory nature of this course we don't have guidance for using them, so you need to do learn it independently, should you want to use one.

Option 1: Hand-coding
```{r img-handcoded, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example of a hand-coded transcript"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/handcoded.jpg")
```

Option 2: Code using Word, by adding comments
```{r img-commentcoded, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example of a transcript coded using comments on Microsoft Word"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/commentcoded.png")
```

Option 3: Construct a table for your codes and quotes. This is an example from Braun & Clarke (2013)
```{r img-tablecoded, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example of a transcript coded using a table"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tablecoded.png")
```

### Activities

#### Activity 1: Example of coding

Have a look at this example of coding (using Thematic Analysis) from Braun & Clarke (2013): [HERE](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EdF3fJaWwyJJuVkP-jVOVPcBlNGsfnv04rsWlavw_pyowA?e=QgIRAO)

Think about the following:

Do you agree/disagree with the codes that the authors have
chosen? Which ones, and why? Are there any additional codes that you think might be worthy of consideration?

#### Activity 2: Try it yourself!

It's time to have a go at coding yourself now!

Read through [this transcript](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/ERHhgbPHADBJuJHk7e2yMtYBb1ddJMCTckAvoXpXB0UYFA?e=UFwJqE), taking brief notes individually the first time you read it. What things did you pick up? If working with others, discuss your codes  - what were the similarities/
differences?

## Developing themes (steps 3-6)

Here, we'll focus on Steps 3 to 6 of the process. These can be found on pages 89-93 of this paper. We also covered how to do Step 3 in in the lecture for Semester 1 Week 11, while Steps 4-6 were  Semester 1 Week 12. For these activities, you are welcome to do them individually or in pairs/small groups  - whichever you
prefer!

### Step 3: Searching for themes

  * In this stage, you should sort the codes into potential themes. Here, you will start to analyse your codes, and consider how they might combine to form an overarching theme.
  * It might be helpful to visualise this in some way, and see how the codes fit together.
  * You may have codes that don’t seem to fit anywhere, others will fit neatly into themes, others might be in sub-themes
  * You end this step with a collection of candidate themes (and/or sub-themes)

**Practical steps:**

  * Start to group your initial codes into broader themes.
  * Can you see a pattern across different codes?
  * What are the similarities across codes?
  * End this stage by collating all the coded quotes relevant to each theme.
  * Themes can be descriptive or interpretative (see Braun & Clarke, 2013, Ch 11). 
  * Using tables or mind maps at this stage can be helpful
  
### Step 4: Reviewing themes

This step involves two levels of reviewing and refining

*Level 1*

Reviewing at the level of the coded extracts. Read all the collated extracts for a theme…do they form a coherent pattern?

If they do, then move on to Level 2.

If they don’t, is it the case that a) the theme itself is problematic or b) the theme is fine, but some of the data doesn’t fit?

*Level 2*

Look across the entire dataset and consider the validity of your theme(s) – does it accurately reflect the meanings in the dataset?

**Practical steps:**

  * This involves checking that the themes ‘work’ in relation to both the coded extracts and the full data-set.
  * Reflect on whether the themes tell a convincing and compelling story about the data, and begin to define the nature of each individual theme, and the relationship between the themes.
  * It may be necessary to collapse two themes together or to split a theme into two or more themes, or to discard the candidate themes altogether and begin again the process of theme development.
  * Not every participant will make specific reference to every theme - that is ok - but think about how each person is represented in the analysis.
  * It can be helpful at this stage to group the relevant quotes together that represent each given theme

### Step 5: Defining and naming themes

  * During this step, you should define and refine the themes.
  * Define and refine = identifying what this theme is about, what aspect of the data is captured by each theme?
  * For each theme, you need to conduct and write a detailed analysis
  * In your report, you will report one theme with sub-themes or two themes (no subthemes) – do they explain different things without overlapping too much?

**Practical steps:**

  * This involves being able to explain each theme: 'What story does this theme tell?’ and ‘how does this theme fit into the overall story about the data?’.
  * Identify the ‘essence’ of each theme and construct a concise, punchy and informative name. Usually, you would aim for two themes for the qualitative report
  
### Step 6: Producing the report

  * The analysis should provide a concise, coherent, logical, non- repetitive and interesting account
  * The write up must provide sufficient evidence of the theme(s) (this is where the quotes come in!)
  * The extracts you choose should clearly illustrate the theme

**Practical steps:**

  * For the report, you should report either two themes (no subthemes) or one theme with 2-3 sub-themes. This is to allow you to balance depth and breadth.
  * Each theme should include approx. three quotes to illustrate it in the write up. Think about which quotes best illustrates your them.
  
### Activities

#### Activity 1: Try it yourself!

We've provided the same transcript as last week, but it's a little longer (to give you more scope to develop themes) - you can find it [here](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EZaA8YkYkyVGkwn0cEDFLCABWr5rREIlMAyIaAPHu3juTg?e=QgyPdd). You can use the codes you developed last time (adding to them for the additional parts of the transcript), or you can recode the data again if you prefer - either option is fine.

  * Once you have your codes, try to organise them into themes.
  * Group together the codes that seem similar in some way - can you think of an overarching 'theme' that describes them? 
  * Are there any codes that don't 'fit' anywhere? (that's okay if so!)
  * Can you identify any quotes that you would use to evidence the themes? Do these definitely match well onto the theme?
  
#### Activity 2: Bad analysis

This is an additional activity and only if you have time/want to delve a bit further. Have a look at the analysis [here](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EXFrzL2zbfBCjDUeP6Py3MUB3p_WS15GyVYXur83wjuYUQ?e=fTMITU). This is an example from Braun & Clarke's book. Why do you think it might be considered a poor example of thematic analysis?

After you've finished, you can look at the points that Braun & Clarke identified [here](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/Eded8-fYVWpOrj5vFY92gyQB0ieRX7BGUhZztrdA5auVhw?e=Pysxhy). Did you identify any additional ones? Were there any you missed?

## Developing a narrative

When doing your thematic analysis, it is important to develop a narrative and go beyond paraphrasing/summarising your data.

Thematic Analysis requires an active approach from an analyst. It is your role to make sense of the data and to present this in a coherent, understandable and accessible way to the reader. You will take these 'patterns of meaning' and make sense of/interpret them, and convey these to the reader.

One point to note: Remember that **themes do not emerge**  - this suggests that they are lying in wait for you to discover them, and that the same themes would come up regardless of the analyst. This is not the case  - your experiences and interpretations will affect the themes you end up with.

When you present your data in the analysis section, you will have a) your list of themes and b) your quotes. It is your job to combine these with analytical commentary, in order to tell the story of your data. It's not enough to present the themes and then back these up with quotes  - your job is to add in a narrative that brings the
themes and the evidence (i.e. quotes) together.

**Semantic and latent analysis**

Thematic Analysis allows you to explore *semantic* or *latent* themes (or both) in your analysis:

*Semantic:* captures explicitly-expressed meaning and stays close to the language of the participants/overt meaning of data, realist. This tends to be somewhat deductive. Semantic approaches still go beyond summarising/paraphrasing.

*Latent:* focuses on a deeper, more implicit meaning of the data. What are the underlying meaning, ideas, concepts? This tends to be a bit more inductive.

**Things to be aware of in developing a narrative**

1. Remember to introduce your theme to the reader – what is it about? Don’t start a theme with a quote. If you have sub- themes, still introduce the overall theme briefly before you discuss your first sub-theme
2. Explain to the reader why you’ve chosen to include each quote. Why is it important enough to be included? What does it tell us about your data?
3. Focus on depth rather than breadth – it is important that we get a real sense of your theme. You only have 3000 words in total, and so will have to choose what you discuss
4. Show the reader who each quote comes from  - we should be able to match this up with the demographics table in the Methods section (which then gives us some context). You can do this by using pseudonyms and linking this to the table by using the same names there too
5. Think about where the opportunities are in your data to go beyond description. Is there anything you can infer? If so, remember to be clear with the reader that this is your interpretation. Your reader should be able why you have interpreted the data this way from the quotes you've chosen.

### Activities

#### Activity 1: Semantic vs. latent
To explore differences between semantic and latent coding, as well as analysing at an illustrative or analytical level, please read [Clarke and Braun (2013)](https://glasgow.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?ho=t&include.ft.matches=t&l=en-UK&bookMark=eNqNzEsKwjAQANABP2i1Z7AXEJJM20nWorjXfRlDWiuhxSbR63sC0f3jZTAfxsHNIDekpS5JU6WVWkImpSk1IdW4gjyEhxBCYoUo5Bp2l2StC6FNvngm9n3k2L9cMbngeLL3LSxa9sHlMI9TchsoTsfr4bzvPIdufDeWI_uxa25YozZkJH4nypAySmj1Y6mpwj_IB5k-RK4) p207-210 and also p252-254.

#### Activity 2: Analysing vs. summarising
Read pages 8-12 from [this thematic analysis](https://study.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/anderson_clarke_reflective_commentary.pdf) on skin-picking. Here, the authors report three themes and then have a reflection at the bottom. Try to identify where the authors have gone beyond paraphrasing  - discuss in your groups/pairs if you can.


## Checklist for a good TA

This checklist is taken from Braun & Clarke (2006)

1. The data have been transcribed to an appropriate level of detail, and the transcripts have been checked against the recordings for accuracy
2. Each data item has been given equal attention in the coding process
3. Themes have not been generated from a few vivid examples (an anecdotal approach), but instead the coding process has been thorough, inclusive, and comprehensive
4. All relevant extracts for each theme have been collated
5. Themes have been checked against each other and back to the original data set
6. Themes are internally coherent, consistent, and distinctive
7. Data have been analysed – interpreted, made sense of – rather than just paraphrased or described
8. Analysis and data match each other – the extracts illustrate the analytic claims
9. Analysis tells a convincing an well-organised story about the data and topic
10. A good balance between analytic narrative and illustrative extracts is provided
11. Enough time has been allocated to complete all phases of the analysis adequately, without rushing a phase or giving it a once-over-lightly
12. The assumptions about, and specific approach to, thematic analysis are clearly explicated
13. There is a good fit between what you claim you do, and what you show you have done – i.e. described method and reported analysis are consistent
14. The language and concepts used in the report are consistent with the epistemological position of the analysis
15. The researcher is positioned as active in the research process; themes do not just ‘emerge’
