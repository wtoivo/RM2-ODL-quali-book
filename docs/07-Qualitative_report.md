# Qualitative report

In this section, you will find information and guidance about your qualitative report and a report writing guide. Please make sure to familiarise yourself with the AIS and FIS on Moodle before starting to work on the report.

## What is the qualitative report?

You will be asked to write an individual qualitative report on one of three secondary data topics. You should conduct Thematic Analysis on your chosen dataset.Watch this video (ADD LINK) for an overview about the report, and make sure you have accessed the AIS and FIS (ADD LINKS) on Moodle before you start working on the report. 

## Report datasets and how to use UK data service

Before accessing your datasets, watch [THIS VIDEO](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/play/vsROyrWqPj8G3f21Tff5nCJ4iXOUSGCu7BT7N4xg7zMWIU9tCJPsTT4pEcJfD46tjf01xtdffznX__oq.3cjWmKRYD1qOsQzX?canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&startTime=1676397171000&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fuofglasgow.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FFtJDqqO9WKzzIZz6exHF2K4FJQJMcHQyrxF-btchS3lUd0q-UY6mYDq1u3zttqzQ.sQK03tO0hhi67guf%3FstartTime%3D1676397171000) on how to use UK data service and for a bit of information about the datasets. Please note that two of the datasets are on sensitive topics, and contain information that may be upsetting; make sure to familiarise yourself with the interview schedules and have a quick scan of the data before you decide which dataset to work with. 

You can access the UK data service [HERE](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/myaccount/login)

You can choose one of the three available datasets: 
  1. [Interviews with disabled young people and carers](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=854556)
  2. [LGBT+ networks in the workplace](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=855322)
  3. [Incentives of sharing research data](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=851540)

## Developing a research question

As part of writing up your qualitative report, we ask that you develop a research question to help you guide your enquiry. Here is some guidance on how to get started:

### Getting started with the data

For this report, you are using secondary data. This means that the data have already been collected using specific interview questions  - before you start thinking about your research question, make sure to have a look at the interview schedule for your chosen dataset (this document will list the interview questions the researchers asked the participants). This should guide you in what questions you might ask and what kind of question you might be able to answer with the available data. You can also take a look at some of the transcripts to get a better feel for the data.

Looking at the data before you decide on your RQ might feel a bit strange after RM1, but remember that you are not doing hypothesis-testing with qualitative designs  - it is quite normal for a qualitative research question to change during the research process, and this is completely fine as you are not statistically testing for a specific effect.

Be mindful that you are not making a research question that is actually one of the interview questions - your RQ should be broader than what the specific interview questions are.

One of the most common mistakes that students make when framing their research question in RM2 is that it is a little too 'quant' in nature. This makes perfect sense, as most of your research methods education so far in the programme has been focused on quant! However, for your qual report, your RQ should be a little different to the RQs you are used to. 

Look at the following examples:

1. How does poor sleep impact on wellbeing? 
2. What is the difference in wellbeing between those who belong to university and those who don't?

Both questions are a bit too quantitative in nature (i.e. 1 is causal and 2 is about a difference between groups). They would also benefit from thinking about what is being looked at, specifically (e.g. views, opinions, experiences).

We'd perhaps rephrase these as follows:

1.  What are students' perceptions of the relationship between sleep and wellbeing?
2. What are online conversion students' experiences of belonging to University? How do these experiences relate to perceived wellbeing?

These questions are now a bit more in line with qualitative and are specific about what they are asking in each (and also what the group of interest is). The second one covers a bit more than the first, which is why it is split into two (a main RQ and a subsidiary one)

### Some tips for developing a research question

  * **Communication:** Keep your research question simple and specific. If you have a very broad question, it can be helpful to break the question down into smaller sub-questions.
  * **Type of question:**  We want the RQ to tap in to more than ‘descriptive’ experience but also offer scope to explore the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of psychological experience–Is the question asking about experiences, understanding, accounts of practice, or influencing factors?  
  * **Practical constraints:** Can the question realistically be explored using thematic analysis and using secondary data? Try not to cover too much
  * **Guiding:** Remember that your RQ guides your enquiry but shouldn't be restrictive  - it's not the case that you are unable to report themes that don't directly answer your RQ. 
  * **Flexibility:** Research questions are more flexible than hypotheses-it is acceptable for the focus of the RQ to be refined during/after data collection.
  
## Activities to help with writing

### Evaluation in introductions

The activities in this section are designed to help you improve your evaluation in the introduction of your RM2 report (and your dissertation). To re-cap from RM1, the purpose of your introduction is to provide a rationale for your study and answer the **WHY** question; why is your study worth doing? You want to sell your idea to the reader, using existing literature to show how you are building on the evidence that is there.

**Things to do and things to avoid**
  
  1. Avoid doing one study per paragraph – instead, build your arguments using multiple sources
  2. Avoid describing previous studies in a lot of detail – instead, show how your study builds on them
  3. Avoid critiques that your study cannot answer - instead, focus on aspects that your study will address
  4. Just because something is never done before, doesn't make it worth doing; show with evidence why we should do the study.



<div class='webex-solution'><button>Show me some examples</button>

Here are paragraphs from an imaginary introduction to a qualitative study investigating postgraduate students' confidence in their zombie apocalypse survival.

**Example 1: Using one source, writing descriptively**
*A study by Lane and Karin (2011) looked at zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students. The sample consisted of 25 participants (20 male and 5 female), recruited through convenience sampling. The study employed involved a survey comprising Likert-scale questions designed to measure participants' self-assessed confidence in various survival skills. Additionally, participants were asked about their exposure to zombie-related media. The data were subjected to t-tests and regression analyses, and the authors’ found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse confidence was exposure to zombie-themed video games.*

This paragraph uses just one source, and describes the study in a lot of detail. Instead, it would be better to synthesise evidence from multiple studies and focus on what the findings mean, rather than being descriptive about the studies. Something like:

*A study by Lane and Karin (2011) found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students was exposure to zombie-themed video games. Miller and Williams (2023) had similar findings, but exposure to zombie films was also a significant predictor of confidence. This suggests that simulation through media is an effective way to increase self-efficacy towards an unknown threat, which has also been found with alien attack research (Ripley, 2017).*

**Example 2: Making criticisms that are outwith the scope of your study**
*It should be noted that the majority of studies on zombie apocalypse survival confidence have looked at samples that consist of mostly men (Lane & Karin, 2011 but see also Grimes & Dixon, 2019), and that previous samples have been small.*

This paragraph makes a criticism that the study cannot address - issues with sample size are not something that we can address with qualitative designs. Instead, to create a stronger rationale, it would be better to focus your critical evaluation on aspects which your study actually builds on:

*While evidence on the behavioural predictors of zombie apocalypse confidence is robust, the majority of research (see Anderson, 2014) has focused on the exposure time to media and survival skills training, we lack understanding of how participants perceive their confidence beyond simulation experiences.*

**Example 3: Why is your study worth doing?**
*To date, there has been only one qualitative study on the topic – Seok (2013) collected data through semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis and two themes, “Survival mode” and “Confidence through skills” were identified. This study looked at undergraduate students; there is no previous literature on postgraduate students’ perceptions of their apocalyptic confidence. Therefore, this qualitative study investigates the perceived confidence of postgraduate students in their abilities to survive a zombie apocalypse.*

Just because it's never been looked at doesn't automatically mean it should be - show with evidence why and how you would expect your new sample to differ and why it's worth exploring:

*Previous research has looked at undergraduate students; however, it has been suggested that postgraduate students would be the group most at risk during a zombie apocalypse (Williams, 2021), but also that apocalyptic self-efficacy decreases with age (Anderson, 2004). This suggests that postgraduate students are the most mentally and physically vulnerable group during a zombie apocalypse, and hence it is important to understand their perceptions of apocalypse confidence, and the lack of thereof.*

#### Activity 1: RM1 feedback

Go back to your feedback from RM1 and see what your marker has said about the evaluation ILO and comments for your introduction. List two things that you did well, and two things you want to improve for RM2? If you would like to discuss the feedback and possible improvement points further, you can pop to Wil's or Ashley's office hours.

Quite often what we see is students engaging with a lot of literature in the intro (which is good!), but not really building a rationale or explaining with evidence why the study is worth doing. We want you to move beyond describing the research to critically evaluating it to show how your study expands on existing knowledge. 

#### Activity 2: Top tips and rationales in published papers

**Tip 1: Show how your study builds on existing literature**
When you are building your rationale, try to use multiple studies to show your reader what the current context of the literature is, and how your study is expanding that knowledge. What new is your study bringing? How is it expanding on existing studies?

If you look at these paragraphs from Robertson et al. (2018), they are building the rationale for their study by showing how it expands on existing literature:

<div class="info">
<p>"Kerns and Kendall (2012) published an updated review of the prevalence of anxiety in individuals with ASD, and all studies fell within White et al. (2009)’s original range for anxiety symptoms (11–84%). It should be noted that, of the 24 studies included in the review, only two reported data for individuals older than 19 years of age (Bakken et al., 2010, Hofvander et al., 2009), which illustrates the need to also focus on adults with ASD in future research (Howlin, 2000)."</p>
<p>"Secondly, as far as we are aware, there have been no qualitative studies investigating anxiety in autism using semi-structured interviews. Although focus groups and interviews are both good data collection methods for qualitative data, there is evidence that individual interviews tend to elicit a broader range of discussion points (Guest, Namey, Taylor, Eley, &amp; McKenna, 2017). Again, this further extends the previous investigation conducted by Trembath et al. (2012)."</p>
</div>

**Tip : Focus your criticism**

When you are critically evaluating studies in your introduction, make  your criticism focused on things that your study is addressing. This  helps you build the rationale. For example, for the RM2 report, don't  focus on the sample size and generalisability of existing studies in your introduction, because these are not things that your study will actually be able to address. Instead, focus on gaps/problems your study can address.
