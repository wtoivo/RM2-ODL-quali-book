## General Project questions

1.I'm not sure how the qualitative portfolio and the qualitative report work
together - should we focus on one before looking at the other?*

The qualitative portfolio is designed to support you in developing skills that would be important for actually running qualitative studies (e.g. reflexivity, developing questions, awareness of ethics, awareness of good/bad practice for data collection). The report is
designed to support you in developing your data analysis skills and then writing up this information into a report.

Re. the timescales - we would advise that you start working (or at least thinking about) the qualitative report before your qualitative portfolio is handed in. However, we realise everyone is different and prefer to work in different ways. We have developed a timeline for the summative assessment with suggested milestones, although you should revise
these deadlines to find something that works for you.
