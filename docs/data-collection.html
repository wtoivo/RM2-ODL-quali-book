</h2>
<p><strong>Informed consent</strong></p>
<p>Before and data collection takes place, you must provide your participants with an information sheet and consent form (see the chapter 5: Ethics for more detail!)</p>
<p>You must give everyone participating the Information sheet and consent form before the focus group/interview takes place. Completed consent forms should be returned to the researcher and you should verbally confirm consent before you start any data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality in Focus groups</strong></p>
<p>Remember that everyone (both those participating and running) the focus group have a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of the discussion.</p>
<p>Discuss some 'ground rules' at the start with the group, and also go through the Information Sheet and consent form at the start, to ensure everyone is aware of their responsibilities. You may also want to include an ice breaker to make your participants feel more comfortable.</p>

<div id="focus-group-structure" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Focus group structure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#focus-group-structure"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are a number of stages to a focus group, and it's not always exactly the same, but here is an example structure for a focus group:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stage 1: Setting the scene.</strong> The topic of the project should be introduced by the facilitator, and everyone agrees to take part. It must be made clear to the people in your focus group a) that they do not have to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable with, b) highlight that the session will be recorded, and they have a choice to have their camera on or off, but that the mic must be used, c) what will happen with the recordings (i.e. that they will be kept safe on University-approved servers and the transcript anonymised), d) that everyone has a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of the topics discussed in the group and e) that they are free to leave the session at any time. Run through the Information Sheet and Consent Form here, and discuss any ground rules you have. I would also raise the point here that there are a few questions to get through, and therefore you might have to step in to help manage time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stage 2: Recording.</strong> Remember to start recording and let your participants know when you do it. This is very important.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stage 3: Introductions.</strong> Go around the table and ask everyone to introduce themselves. Start with yourself and the note-taker first. Everyone should state their first name clearly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stage 4: Ice-breaker.</strong> Ask a warm-up question or ice-breaker. The aim is to allow participants to introduce themselves, ensure everyone understands the procedure, and to encourage people to feel comfortable talking. Previous projects have used photos, cartoons, and media, or asked participants to generate meanings of the terms used in the discussion (e.g., “poor sleep”,”well-being”) to get people talking.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stage 5: Discussion.</strong> This is where you ask your main questions, and follow-up questions. It is a good idea to prepare around five or six main questions, and perhaps highlight three or four that are most important to focus on. The discussion may follow a different order to that on the focus group schedule - this is fine.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stage 6: Facilitating the discussion.</strong> The facilitator should be prepared to help steer conversation back on track, and balance discussion so that everyone gets a chance to contribute. Have a few specific prompts that relate to each question and/or some general prompts to keep the discussion flowing. What are you going to do if no-one participates? Or if one person is contributing? For example… “has anyone else had a similar experience? Does anyone have a different view?” At the same time be ethical and avoid targeting people. Give participants the opportunity to describe their interpretations and take ownership. E.g., “How would…make you feel”, “Have you ever noticed that…” “Think back to when…”, “What was most important to you about…?”</li>
<li>
<strong>Stage 7: Ending the discussion.</strong> It's good to end the discussion by going round the group and asking each participant if they have anything they want to add to the discussion/sum up their thoughts on what was discussed.Remember to allow focus group members the chance to confirm/withdraw consent for their anonymised contributions to be used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Facilitation and note-taking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#facilitation-and-note-taking"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Facilitation/moderation</strong></p>
<p>The facilitator (sometimes also known as the moderator) will be the person taking the lead during the focus group. They will be the one asking the questions of the participants, and the one facilitating the discussion. As you are aiming to mimic a naturalistic conversation, you have to build rapport. Ensure you allow everyone time to introduce themselves, and contribute to the ice-breaking phase by saying a bit about yourself.</p>
<p>A good facilitator shares the perspective of the people they are talking to throughout the focus group. The moderator should not be listening out for good quotes and should not be thinking about what to analyse. The role of the facilitator is to listen to the participants, and understand their points of view.</p>
<p><strong>Note-taking</strong></p>
<p>It is a good idea to have a note-taker there. Hopefully there will be no IT issues that mean that the recording doesn't work! Therefore, the note-taker should remind the facilitator about recording if required, and note down any impressions/initial thoughts around themes/good quotes. Also, you could note down how well the questions worked - were there any that participants didn't understand? It should be clear from the recording who is contributing when; it is useful to note down here and there who is speaking at various points, to ensure it matches up later on.</p>

</h2>
<p>Focus groups are designed to be an informal discussion in a moderated setting. This allows for the data collection to be flexible and occur in a collective, more natural way - however, moderating a discussion in a group setting can also be challenging. Below we have some top tips for how to manage focus groups.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make sure your participants are comfortable: establish ground rules and expectations at the start, ensure that you are interested in their perceptions and experiences and that there are no right or wrong answers, start with an ice-breaker to warm your participants up and make sure nobody is put on the spot and participants don't feel pressured to answer anything they do not wish to answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage the conversation effectively: make sure all participants have the opportunity to contribute if they wish and one participant doesn't dominate the whole conversation, ensure that conversation doesn't stray off topic or get stuck on one topic for too long. Give prompts if the participants struggle to get started on a question.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay neutral and <em>listen</em>: be careful not to provide your own opinion or views (this is surprisingly easy to do accidentally!) - this is about your participants and their experiences. Focus on listening to the participants and clarifying/prompting further if needed, give your participants time to gather their thoughts (learn to be comfortable with silent moments and don't fill them in with your opinions).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>View below some situations you may encounter when running a focus group: before checking the answer, have a think how you would manage these scenarios and discuss the answers with your group.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One/some participants are very quiet and one participant dominates the conversation</li>

<div class="webex-solution">

</button>
<ul>
<li>The ice-breaker/easy opening questions are perhaps most important for quieter members of the group, to help make them feel more comfortable.</li>
<li>If you are running the focus group online, it might be a good idea to use the Raise hand feature - this would allow quieter members to show that they want to contribute, but without trying to gauge when to jump in the conversation. You can then take points in order of when they raised their hands.</li>
<li>If some people have contributed to part of the discussion and others haven't, open it up to the rest by asking if anyone who hasn't responded yet has anything to add. However, don't put people on the spot by asking them directly.</li>
<li>Make sure to distribute turns equally</li>
</ul>

<li>If the participant does not know how to elaborate, you can ask if anybody else wants to add anything. Sometimes this will prompt the participant to build on their answer as a response to what the other participants are saying.</li>

<span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Facilitating interviews<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#facilitating-interviews"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Interviews are very different to focus groups, as the data collection is typically set up in a one-on-one situation. This means the types of questions you should ask, the types of answer you are likely to get, and the practical issues are quite different to focus groups. Here are some top tips for how to conduct an interview.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an effort to develop rapport and make the participant feel comfortable.</li>
<li>If you are doing a sensitive topic, pay attention to how your participant is presenting and ask them if they need a break or if they would like to continue.</li>
<li>Focus on the person rather than taking notes - are you giving them encouragement to keep speaking (e.g. nods etc.)?</li>
<li>If doing a semi-structured interview, pay attention to whether the participant brings something up that could/should be followed up with an addional question</li>
<li>Not all interviews will be the same length - some people are very concise in how they answer whereas others talk a lot more so the overall interview length will vary</li>
<li>Try to end on a positive question if you can - it can help to lift the mood for the participant and leave them in a good place</li>

<p>GDPR: general data protection regulation. It is the most up to date data protection law and your data collection and storage must comply to the GDPR principles.</p>
<p>See the University guidelines on handling confidential data <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/it/informationsecurity/confidentialdata/" class="uri">https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/it/informationsecurity/confidentialdata/</a>.

<p>Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a data management plan in place before data collection (how and where are you storing the data, who will have access to it, how ling do you need to store it for, what steps of confidentiality and anonymisation are you taking?)</li>
<li>Participants are made aware of your data management plan prior to any data collection in the information sheet and consent form</li>
<li>Data should be retained until after completion of the project on a password-protected encrypted drive and a secure database accessible only to the research team</li>
<li>Only use University-approved systems to collect, manage and store data - <strong>do not use external providers (such as Google or Dropbox)</strong>, as they may not be GDPR compliant</li>
<li>If you share the data, your participants should be informed about this prior to taking part, and you should only share the anonymised data files</li>
<li><strong>Do not share data via social media, google drive or personal email which is not secure.</strong></li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be organised - get ethics in early etc., keep track of potentialparticipants</li>
<li>Think through all the different steps involved as you will need to refer to this in your ethics application - how do you plan to recruit, collect the data, store the data? Before you start collecting data, it would be good to have a checklist with everything you need to consider</li>
<li>Only collect the demographics that you need - if you don't need to know how many siblings they have or what time they go to bed, then don't ask for that information</li>
<li>Be sensitive to who your participants are - you might ask different questions in a focus group (where people are in front of others) than you would in an online questionnaire (where it is easier to withdraw if uncomfortable).</li>
<li>Think about how you keep that data safe/anonymous</li>
<li>Know in advance how many participants you need</li>
<li>Know how you plan to analyse the data</li>
<li>Consider what you can do to make the experience as
comfortable as possible for participants (e.g. sending out questions in advance is particularly helpful for neurodivergent people/people who do not speak English as a first language).</li>
<li>For interviews and focus groups - reassert consent before you start &amp; always remember to press record! Also it's normal to feel a bt nervous - try to enjoy the process!</li>
<li>For all, pilot the questions you ask - make sure that people take from them what you think</li>
<li>When recruiting, think about who your target group is and it's good to justify why you are looking for a particular demographic. For example, do you definitely require someone to have a particular diagnosis?</li>

<li>Try to focus on the person rather than taking notes - are you giving them encouragement to keep speaking (e.g. nods etc.)?</li>

<li>It's usual for some interviews to be shorter than others - some people are very concise in how they answer whereas others talk a lot more (and this may be on topic or not</li>
<li>Be aware of how someone is presenting - this is less relevant for coursework and more for future projects - if you are doing quite a sensitive topic, it's good practice to reassert consent and to ask people if they need a break for a little while/if they are okay to continue.</li>
<li>Try to end on a positive question if you can - it can help to lift the mood for the participant and leave them in a good place</li>

<ul>
<li>Think about whether there would be any possibility for the questions to be misinterpreted - you won't have a chance to correct people if they interpret something wrong (this is where doing a pilot can be useful)</li>
<li>Try not to have too many questions - what are the key things you want to know? People will be less likely to respond with long, in depth answers if there are a lot of questions to answer.</li>
<li>It might be good to give an indication of how many questions they have to go through.</li>
<li>Easier to keep data anonymous than it is with other forms of data collection above - however still be sensitive to locations, names, personal experiences as these will have to be anonymised.</li>
