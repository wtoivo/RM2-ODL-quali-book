# Group project

## What is the group project?

## Getting to know each other in groups

This section is designed for you to engage with your group early, get to know each other, and develop some common guidelines for working together before you embark on the group project. If you haven't done so yet, please get in touch with your group now to complete the following activities:

### Activity 1: Create a group chat

Get in touch with your group and create a Teams chat. You **MUST** use Teams for all communication about the group project. Do not use any other platforms (such as Whatsapp, WeChat, Facebook etc.) as these can lead to people being excluded.

### Activity 2: Introductions

Introduce yourself to your group members on your Teams chat. In your introduction, tell your group where you are based, which parts of the degree you have enjoyed the most up to date and what is your favourite R function. As a group, find one *non-psychology/university related thing that you all have in common* and share that on the RM2 Teams channel in the thread. Bonus points for the most random common thing!

### Activity 3: Group agreements

We appreciate that group work can be challenging (and even more so if you are spread all over the World!) and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and some rules that each of the group members is committed to. 

Download the group agreement template from [HERE](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EX0j7-IboldEnapucgQ7h-YBERu8yPzvpIZa7R_AQu8jhw?e=QmqDXz). 

Then look at the list of potential items to include below, and as a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list. Work on a collaborative document on OneDrive to create your group work agreement, and once the group is happy with their agreement, each group member should submit it to Moodle individually (on the Formative Activities tile). ***Please submit your group agreement by the end of week 14 of semester 1.*** If you haven't submitted your agreements, we will be in touch to check up on your group.

**Group agreement items**

Here is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the group agreement:

  * We all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group
  * We all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.
  * We all agree to respect each other's individual ways of working and discuss these openly as a group. 
  * We all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks. 
  * We agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.
  * I agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group. If I am struggling and I do not feel comfortable sharing that with the group, I will get in touch with the course/programme leads for support
  * We all agree to meet on a regular basis as established by the group. If I cannot make a meeting I agree to communicate this openly with my group and get in touch to catch up about things I have missed.
  * We agree to plan out the individual contribution of each team member in advance before group work starting and openly communicate any changes that may arise during the project.
  * We agree to establish the best method of communication for our group that's inclusive and takes into account everybody's individual needs.
  
### Activity 4: Read the Effective Group work document

This document can be used as a checklist to do the group work for your qualitative portfolio. Give it a read and then discuss it with your group once you have your initial meeting. The effective group work guide can be found [HERE](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EZCuPb2m-MFMtAIGTAb2eM4B_ateTxqyR5X6YLceaL2Qcg?e=XeHk9h)
